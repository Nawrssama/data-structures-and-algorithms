# Graph 

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

>add vertex


```Arguments: value

Returns: The added vertex

Add a vertex to the graph
```

>add edge



```Arguments: 2 vertices to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)

Returns: nothing

Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph

If specified, assign a weight to the edge

Both vertices should already be in the Graph
```

>get vertices


```Arguments: none

Returns all of the vertices in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

Empty collection returned if there are no vertices
```

>get neighbors


```Arguments: vertex

Returns a collection of edges connected to the given vertex

Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

Empty collection returned if there are no vertices
```

>size


```Arguments: none

Returns the total number of vertices in the graph

0 if there are none
```

>breadth first


```Write the following method for the Graph class:

breadth first
Arguments: Node
Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
Display the collection
```

>bisness trip


```Write a function called business trip
Arguments: graph, array of city names
Return: the cost of the trip (if itâ€™s possible) or null (if not)
Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
```
