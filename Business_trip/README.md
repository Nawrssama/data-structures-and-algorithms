# Solution 

    def business_trip(graph, cities):
        total_cost = 0

        for i in range(len(cities) - 1):
            current_city = cities[i]
            next_city = cities[i + 1]

            if current_city not in graph :
                return None  
            if next_city not in graph[current_city]:
                return None

            total_cost += graph[current_city][next_city]

        return f"${total_cost}"
